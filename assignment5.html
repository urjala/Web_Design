            <h2><u><b>computer</b></u></h2> 
<pr>
    A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of <br>
    arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform <br>
    generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide <br>
    range of tasks.<br><i> A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, <br>
    operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This<br>
     term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer <br>
     network or computer cluster.</i>
