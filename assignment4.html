            <h2><u><b>NEPAL</b></u></h2> 
<pr>
    Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/;[14] Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]), formerly the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal<br>
     (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल),[15] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in<br>
      the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering the Tibet Autonomous Region <br>
      of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh <br>
      by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including<br>
       fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest,<br>
        the highest point on Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with<br>
         Nepali as the official language. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city.
